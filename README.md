#### Introduction
This is the second assignment of the "Computer Vision and Deep Learning" course at NCKU, aiming to implement techniques such as Background Subtraction, Optical Flow, PCA - Dimension Reduction, Training a MNIST Classifier Using VGG19 with BN, and Train a Cat-Dog Classifier Using ResNet50.


#### Establishing Environment
Refer to [CvDl_hw1](https://github.com/SuNsHiNe-75/CvDl_hw1).  

In addition, we should download this also:  
```shell
pip install scikit-learn
```


#### Run
In the Q1toQ5 folder:  
```shell
python main.py
```


#### Notice
- Due to the large size of the trained model, it has not been uploaded to this repository. If you want to run the fifth and fourth question of this project, you will need to train the model yourself.
- If you want to use the pyqt5 package, you may need to configure some things in your IDE (for example, install relevant extensions in VSCode).
- After the UI window pops up, there are corresponding images/videos needed to be imported first for each question. Pay attention to the execution order.
